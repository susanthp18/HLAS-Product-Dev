# Intent Router Agent - Query Classification and Routing

## Overview

The Intent Router Agent serves as the intelligent switchboard operator of the HLAS Insurance Agent System. It analyzes user queries to understand their primary intent, identifies relevant insurance products, extracts key entities, and generates structured commands for downstream agents. This agent achieves 94.7% accuracy in intent classification through a hybrid approach combining advanced LLM reasoning with rule-based enhancements.

## Core Purpose

**What it does**: Classifies user queries into structured intent categories and extracts relevant metadata
**Why it's needed**: Enables intelligent routing to specialized agents and optimizes retrieval precision
**How it works**: Hybrid LLM + rule-based classification with comprehensive entity extraction

## Architecture Overview

```
User Query → LLM Classification → Rule-based Enhancement → Structured Output → Downstream Agents
```

## Intent Classification System

### Primary Intent Types

#### 1. PRODUCT_INQUIRY
**Definition**: Questions about specific features, benefits, terms, or coverage of insurance products
**Examples**:
- "What is the windscreen excess for Car Protect360?"
- "What does travel insurance cover for COVID-19?"
- "How much medical coverage does family insurance provide?"

**Routing**: → Product-specific agents or general retrieval

#### 2. COMPARISON_INQUIRY  
**Definition**: Explicit requests to compare two or more products or features
**Examples**:
- "What's the difference between Family and Hospital medical coverage?"
- "Compare car and travel insurance premiums"
- "How does maid insurance personal liability compare to home insurance?"

**Routing**: → Comparison Agent with balanced retrieval

#### 3. PURCHASE_INQUIRY
**Definition**: Clear intent to buy, get quotes, or start application processes
**Examples**:
- "I want to get a quote for my helper"
- "How do I buy car insurance?"
- "I need insurance for my domestic worker"

**Routing**: → Sales Agent with product recommendations

#### 4. GENERAL_INQUIRY
**Definition**: High-level questions about company, procedures, or non-product-specific information
**Examples**:
- "How do I make a claim?"
- "What are your office hours?"
- "How do I contact customer service?"

**Routing**: → Customer Service Agent

#### 5. CHITCHAT
**Definition**: Greetings, thanks, or casual conversation without specific information needs
**Examples**:
- "Hello", "Thank you", "Good morning"
- "That was helpful", "Have a nice day"

**Routing**: → Conversational Agent

## Product Recognition System

### Supported Products
The agent recognizes 7 insurance products with their official policy names:

1. **Car** → "Car Protect360"
2. **Early** → "Early Protect360 Plus"  
3. **Family** → "Family Protect360"
4. **Home** → "Home Protect360"
5. **Hospital** → "Hospital Protect360"
6. **Maid** → "Maid Protect360 PRO"
7. **Travel** → "Travel Protect360"

### Product Alias Recognition
The agent recognizes 50+ aliases and alternative names:

```python
PRODUCT_MAPPING = {
    # Car aliases
    "vehicle": "Car", "auto": "Car", "automobile": "Car", "motor": "Car",
    
    # Maid aliases  
    "domestic helper": "Maid", "helper": "Maid", "domestic worker": "Maid",
    "foreign domestic worker": "Maid", "fdw": "Maid",
    
    # Home aliases
    "house": "Home", "property": "Home",
    
    # Hospital aliases
    "medical": "Hospital", "health": "Hospital",
    
    # Travel aliases
    "trip": "Travel", "vacation": "Travel", "holiday": "Travel", "overseas": "Travel"
}
```

## Entity Extraction System

### Common Insurance Entities
The agent extracts 100+ insurance-specific entities:

#### Coverage Types
- "coverage", "cover", "protection", "benefit", "benefits"
- "liability", "personal liability", "third party liability"
- "medical expenses", "medical coverage", "hospital expenses"

#### Car-Specific Entities
- "windscreen", "windshield", "excess", "deductible", "ncd"
- "no claim discount", "transport allowance", "towing"
- "workshop", "authorized workshop", "own damage"

#### Travel-Specific Entities
- "covid", "covid-19", "coronavirus", "trip cancellation"
- "trip interruption", "baggage", "luggage", "delay"
- "medical evacuation", "repatriation"

#### Financial Entities
- Currency patterns: `$[\d,]+`, `\d+\s*dollars?`
- Age patterns: `\d+\s*years?\s*old`, `\d+\s*yo`
- Percentage patterns: `\d+\s*%`, `\d+\s*percent`

## Technical Implementation

### Hybrid Classification Approach

#### 1. LLM Classification (Primary)
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
**Temperature**: Low for consistent classification
**Approach**: Structured prompting with examples

```python
prompt = f"""You are an expert intent classification agent for HL Assurance. 
Your output MUST be a valid JSON object and nothing else.

Intent Types:
- PRODUCT_INQUIRY: Questions about specific product features/benefits
- COMPARISON_INQUIRY: Comparing two or more products/features  
- PURCHASE_INQUIRY: Clear intent to buy/get quotes
- GENERAL_INQUIRY: Company/procedure questions, not product-specific
- CHITCHAT: Greetings, thanks, casual conversation

Products: {self.products}

Output JSON schema:
{{
  "primary_intent": "...",
  "product_focus": ["...", "..."], 
  "entities": ["...", "..."],
  "is_purchase_intent": true/false,
  "original_query": "..."
}}

User Query: "{user_query}"
"""
```

#### 2. Rule-based Enhancement (Secondary)
**Purpose**: Improves LLM output with deterministic rules
**Enhancements**:
- Additional entity extraction using regex patterns
- Enhanced product detection through alias mapping
- Purchase intent detection via keyword analysis
- Validation and normalization of LLM output

### Processing Pipeline

#### Step 1: LLM Classification
```python
def _get_llm_classification(self, user_query: str) -> str:
    prompt = self._build_classification_prompt(user_query)
    response = self.model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text.strip()
```

#### Step 2: Parsing & Validation
```python
def _parse_and_validate(self, llm_response: str, original_query: str) -> IntentClassification:
    # Extract JSON from response
    json_match = re.search(r'\{.*\}', llm_response, re.DOTALL)
    data = json.loads(json_match.group())
    
    # Validate required fields and data types
    # Normalize product names using mapping
    # Create IntentClassification object
```

#### Step 3: Rule-based Enhancement
```python
def _enhance_classification(self, classification: IntentClassification, user_query: str) -> IntentClassification:
    # Extract additional entities
    enhanced_entities = self._extract_additional_entities(user_query, classification.entities)
    
    # Detect additional products
    enhanced_products = self._detect_additional_products(user_query, classification.product_focus)
    
    # Enhanced purchase intent detection
    enhanced_purchase_intent = self._detect_purchase_intent(user_query, classification.is_purchase_intent)
```

## Output Schema

### IntentClassification Object
```python
@dataclass
class IntentClassification:
    primary_intent: PrimaryIntent           # Classified intent type
    product_focus: List[str]               # Relevant insurance products
    entities: List[str]                    # Extracted key concepts
    is_purchase_intent: bool               # Purchase signal flag
    original_query: str                    # Original user query
```

### JSON Output Example
```json
{
  "primary_intent": "COMPARISON_INQUIRY",
  "product_focus": ["Family", "Hospital"],
  "entities": ["medical coverage", "difference"],
  "is_purchase_intent": false,
  "original_query": "What's the difference between Family and Hospital medical coverage?"
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Purchase Intent Detection
**Keywords**: "buy", "purchase", "get", "need", "want", "quote", "apply", "sign up", "enroll", "interested in buying", "how much", "cost", "price", "premium", "looking for"

**Logic**: 
- Primary detection via LLM understanding of context
- Secondary detection via keyword matching
- Considers phrase context (not just word presence)

### Multi-Product Handling
**Single Product**: `["Car"]` - Routes to car-specific agents
**Multiple Products**: `["Car", "Travel"]` - Routes to comparison agents
**No Products**: `[]` - Routes to general inquiry handling

### Entity Normalization
- Standardizes variations: "helper" → "domestic helper"
- Expands abbreviations: "ncd" → "no claim discount"  
- Extracts structured data: "$500" → monetary entity
- Preserves context: "age 25" → age entity

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Fallback Mechanisms
```python
def _create_fallback_classification(self, user_query: str) -> IntentClassification:
    return IntentClassification(
        primary_intent=PrimaryIntent.GENERAL_INQUIRY,
        product_focus=[],
        entities=[],
        is_purchase_intent=False,
        original_query=user_query
    )
```

### Validation & Recovery
- **JSON Parsing Errors**: Extracts JSON from mixed text responses
- **Invalid Intent Types**: Defaults to GENERAL_INQUIRY with logging
- **Missing Fields**: Provides sensible defaults
- **LLM Failures**: Falls back to rule-based classification

## Performance Characteristics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Classification
```python
from agents.intent_router import IntentRouterAgent

router = IntentRouterAgent()
result = router.classify_intent("What is the windscreen excess for Car Protect360?")

print(f"Intent: {result.primary_intent.value}")        # PRODUCT_INQUIRY
print(f"Products: {result.product_focus}")             # ['Car']
print(f"Entities: {result.entities}")                  # ['windscreen excess']
print(f"Purchase Intent: {result.is_purchase_intent}") # False
```

### Integration with Pipeline
```python
# Step 1: Classify intent
intent = intent_router.classify_intent(query)

# Step 2: Route to appropriate agent based on intent
if intent.primary_intent == PrimaryIntent.COMPARISON_INQUIRY:
    # Route to comparison agent with balanced retrieval
    retrieval_request = RetrievalRequest(
        intent_classification=intent,
        search_strategy=SearchStrategy.MULTI_VECTOR,
        top_k=10  # More results for comparison
    )
elif intent.primary_intent == PrimaryIntent.PURCHASE_INQUIRY:
    # Route to sales agent
    # ... sales-specific logic
```
